# CDS-492-Capston-Project: Global Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis (1990–2021)

Statistical analysis of global life expectancy trends and GDP (1990–2021) using R.  
Project completed as part of **CDS 492 Capstone Project, George Mason University (Fall 2024).**  

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy** using datasets from the **UNDP Human Development Reports** and **World Bank Open Data**.  
It analyzes disparities across **countries, continents, and Human Development Index (HDI) groups**, providing insights that align with **Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).**

## Datasets
- **Source**: UNDP Human Development Reports, World Bank Open Data  
- **Timeframe**: 1990–2021  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - Life Expectancy (by country, continent, HDI group)  
  - GDP per capita (annual, by country)  
  - Human Development Groups (Low, Medium, High, Very High)  

---

## Methods & Tools
- **Language**: R (RStudio)  
- **Key Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `reshape2`, `plotly`, `rnaturalearth`  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Group-wise summary statistics (Mean, Min, Max, SD)  
  - ANOVA & Tukey’s HSD (continent comparison)  
  - Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, choropleth maps)  
  - Automated CSV + PNG export for reproducibility  

---

## Analyses by Script
- **country.R** → Country-level analysis (top/bottom 5 countries each year, trends from 1990–2021)  
- **continent.R** → Continent-level boxplots, scatterplots, ANOVA, and year-by-year breakdown  
- **GDP.R** → GDP comparisons (top/bottom 10 countries, yearly dynamics, choropleth world maps)  
- **HD.R** → Life expectancy by Human Development groups (Low, Medium, High, Very High)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pcw419/CDS-492-Capstone-Project.git
   cd CDS-492-Capstone-Project -->


## Results <!-- 이거 보여줄 지 말지 결정 (Highlights) -->

Positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
Regional disparities: Africa consistently lowest, Europe & Oceania highest.
HDI effect: Life expectancy increases systematically from Low → Very High groups.
GDP gap widening: Top 10 vs. bottom 10 countries show divergent growth patterns.
