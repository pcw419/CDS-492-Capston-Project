# CDS-492-Capston-Project: Global Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis
Statistical analysis of global life expectancy vs. GDP (1990–2021) using R with UNDP and World Bank data

## Overview
This project (completed in Fall 2024 as part of CDS 492 at George Mason University) analyzes global life expectancy trends from 1990 to 2021 using datasets from the UNDP and World Bank. The main objective is to explore the relationship between GDP and life expectancy, highlighting disparities across regions and offering policy insights aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

## Datasets
- **Source**: UNDP Human Development Reports, World Bank Open Data  
- **Timeframe**: 1990–2021  
- **Key Variables**: GDP per capita, life expectancy, region, country  

## Methods & Tools
- **Language**: R (RStudio)  
- **Libraries**: tidyverse, ggplot2  
- **Techniques**: Exploratory Data Analysis, ANOVA, regression models, data visualization  

## Results
- Found a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy.  
- Identified significant disparities across different regions and countries.  
- Provided insights relevant to policy decisions and SDG 11.
