# Global Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis (1990–2021)

Capstone Project for **CDS 492 (Fall 2024)**  
Statistical analysis of global life expectancy trends and GDP (1990–2021) using R.  

---

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy** using datasets from the **UNDP Human Development Reports** and **World Bank Open Data**.  
It analyzes disparities across **countries, continents, and Human Development Index (HDI) groups**, providing insights that align with **Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).**

## Datasets
- **Source**: UNDP Human Development Reports, World Bank Open Data  
- **Timeframe**: 1990–2021  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - Life Expectancy (by country, continent, HDI group)  
  - GDP per capita (annual, by country)  
  - Human Development Groups (Low, Medium, High, Very High)  

---

## Methods & Tools
- **Language**: R (RStudio)  
- **Key Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `reshape2`, `plotly`, `rnaturalearth`  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Group-wise summary statistics (Mean, Min, Max, SD)  
  - **ANOVA & Tukey’s HSD** (continent-level comparisons)  
  - Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, choropleth maps)  
  - Automated CSV + PNG export for reproducibility  

---

## Results

**Key Findings:**
- Positive correlation between **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy**.  
- **Regional disparities**: Africa consistently lowest, Europe & Oceania highest.  
- **HDI effect**: Life expectancy increases systematically from Low → Very High groups.  
- **GDP gap widening**: Top 10 vs. bottom 10 countries show divergent growth patterns.  
- **ANOVA (1990)**: Significant differences in life expectancy among continents (F = 59.79, p < 2e-16).  
  - Tukey’s HSD: Europe & Oceania significantly higher than Africa; Asia & America intermediate.

## Data Sources
- [UNDP: Human Development and Life Expectancy Data](https://hdr.undp.org/)  
- [World Bank: GDP Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?view=map&year=2008)  

The repository includes two initial datasets:
- `yearGDPgrowth.csv` (World Bank GDP data, 1990–2021)  
- `humandevelopment1990-2021.csv` (UNDP Human Development data, 1990–2021)  

Other CSVs (`country1990-2021.csv`, `continent1990-2021.csv`) are generated during preprocessing and analysis, so they are not stored in this repo.

## Notes
This repository is structured for reproducibility: all figures and tables can be regenerated by running the scripts.
